By: Mahima Nema

1. Introduction Netflix Movie Data Analysis
Have you ever scrolled through Netflix and wondered — what kind of movies really fill up the platform? Which genres dominate? What do audiences love? And what trends shape Netflix’s massive library?
That’s exactly what this project sets out to uncover.

2. Dataset Overview
I worked with a dataset containing 9827 Netflix movie records with details such as:Title, Release Date, Genre,Popularity,VoteAverage,Vote Count. The dataset was clean, free of missing or duplicate values, though it required some organizing to extract meaningful insights.

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
To make the dataset analysis-ready, I performed the following:
Converted release dates to year only — to track trends over time.
Dropped irrelevant columns like movie overviews, original language, and poster URLs.
Categorized vote averages into four groups:Not Popular, Below Average, Average, Popular
Split multiple genres into individual rows — so multi-genre movies could be accurately counted in each category.
This step was crucial to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

4. Genre Distribution
After processing, I explored: Which genres dominate Netflix?
Drama emerged as the most frequent genre on Netflix — highlighting the platform’s preference for emotional, narrative-driven content.

5. Audience Ratings
I then looked into how viewers rated these movies.
By categorizing the vote averages, I observed: Most movies were rated as Average.
This indicates that while Netflix offers variety, a significant chunk of its content receives moderate reception.

6. Most & Least Popular Titles
Popularity and audience ratings often tell different stories.
Most Popular Movie: Spider-Man: No Way Home, Genres: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Popularity Score: 5083.954
Least Popular Movies:The United States vs. Billie Holiday (Music, Drama, History), Threads (War, Drama, Science Fiction)

7. Year-wise Movie Releases
I examined which year saw the most Netflix movie releases.
2020 recorded the highest number of movie releases — reflecting Netflix’s aggressive content production strategy.

8. Key Takeaways
Drama is the most frequent genre on Netflix. Most movies fall into the Average rating category. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the most popular movie in the dataset. 2020 had the highest number of movie releases. These insights can influence decisions around content curation, marketing, and audience engagement strategies.

9. Final Thoughts
This project illustrates how structured data analysis and visualization can tell powerful stories about audience preferences and content trends on a global platform like Netflix.
It’s not just about numbers — it’s about understanding what people watch, love, and respond to.
